# Robot win Data Visualization

Compares different weapon types of BattleBots across many filters, including drive system and weight class. Additionally, there is a dynamic game that shows the win-loss chance of the chosen type and filter of the BattleBot. The visualization includes:

### Bar Graph: 
Shows the win and loss records of each weapon type across all criteria and in general.

### Pie Chart: 
Quickly visualizes the chosen weapon for the game and helps determine which one has a higher chance of winning.

### Animation:
Hand drawn animations show which bot would win in a theoretical fight.

The victor is chosen by a weighted coin flip based on the robot's chances of winning.

### Data:
The data was collected by getting the 100 best robots from each weight category on the NHRL wiki. Some are longer than others, 
potential sources of bias include the prevalence of vertical spinners in the best robots while potentially excluding subpar performing robots.
